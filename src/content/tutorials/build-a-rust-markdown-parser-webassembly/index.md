# Build a Markdown Parser with Rust and WebAssembly

This tutorial will walk you through the steps of generating, building, previewing, configuring, and publishing
a Rust-generated WebAssembly serverless function that parses Markdown for Cloudflare Workers. Let's get started!

This tutorial makes use of [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler), our command-line tool for generating, building, and publishing projects on the Cloudflare Workers platform. If you haven't used Wrangler, we recommend [installing Wrangler](/cli-wrangler/install-update), or checking out our [Getting Started guide](/learning/getting-started), which will get you set up with Wrangler, and familiar with the basic commands.

## Generating from template

Cloudflare's command-line tool for managing Workers projects, Wrangler, has great support for templates â€“ pre-built collections of code that make it easy to get started writing Workers. We'll make use of the [rustwasm-worker template](https://github.com/cloudflare/rustwasm-worker-template/) to start building your project.

In the command line, generate your Workers project by passing in a project name (we'll use rustwasm-markdown-parser), and the template URL to base your project on.

```sh
wrangler generate rustwasm-markdown-parser https://github.com/cloudflare/rustwasm-worker-template/
```

This creates a directory called `rustwasm-markdown-parser` which you can now `cd` into.

Wrangler templates are just Git repositories, so if you want to create your own templates, or use one from our [Template Gallery](/templates), there's a ton of options to help you get started.

## Testing locally

You can test how your Workers function will look when it's deployed by using the preview service, which you can access with the `wrangler dev` command:

```sh
wrangler dev
```

[`wrangler dev`](/cli-wrangler/commands#dev) starts a server on localhost that executes your Worker on incoming HTTP requests. By default, it'll listen on port :8787. 

<Aside>The first time you run `wrangler dev` might take a couple minutes to compile to WebAssembly. </Aside>

When navigating to localhost:8787 in your browser, you should see something like this:

![Hello wasm-worker](./media/hello-wasm-worker.png)


## Building your code

Let's make our Workers function more interesting. We'll pull in a dependency from the `crates.io` ecosystem called `pulldown-cmark`.
We'll add this to our `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
## Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
pulldown-cmark = "0.4.0"
```

Now we'll leverage the code in the `string-to-string` example from the `pulldown-cmark` GitHub repository. Let's change
our `src/lib.rs` to look like this:

```rust
// src/lib.rs

mod utils;

use cfg_if::cfg_if;
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
use pulldown_cmark::{Parser, Options, html};

cfg_if! {
    // When the `wee_alloc` feature is enabled, use `wee_alloc` as the global
    // allocator.
    if #[cfg(feature = "wee_alloc")] {
        extern crate wee_alloc;
        #[global_allocator]
        static ALLOC: wee_alloc::WeeAlloc = wee_alloc::WeeAlloc::INIT;
    }
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn parse() -> String {
    let markdown_input: &str = "Hello world, this is a ~~complicated~~ *very simple* example.";
    println!("Parsing the following markdown string:\n{}", markdown_input);

    // Set up options and parser. Strikethroughs are not part of the CommonMark standard
    // and we therefore must enable it explicitly.
    let mut options = Options::empty();
    options.insert(Options::ENABLE_STRIKETHROUGH);
    let parser = Parser::new_ext(markdown_input, options);

    // Write to String buffer.
    let mut html_output: String = String::with_capacity(markdown_input.len() * 3 / 2);
    html::push_html(&mut html_output, parser);

    // Check that the output is what we expected.
    let expected_html: &str = "<p>Hello world, this is a <del>complicated</del> <em>very simple</em> example.</p>\n";
    assert_eq!(expected_html, &html_output);

    format!("\nHTML output:\n{}", &html_output)
}
```

Now we'll update our `worker/worker.js` to use the new code we've written:

```javascript
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

/**
 * Fetch and log a request
 * @param {Request} request
 */
async function handleRequest(request) {
    const { parse } = wasm_bindgen;
    await wasm_bindgen(wasm)
    const output = parse()
    let res = new Response(output, {status: 200})
    res.headers.set("Content-type", "text/html")
    return res
}
```

Whenever we run `dev` or `publish`, `wrangler` will build our project. But if you just want to `build` and not
`dev` or `publish`, you can run the `build` command:

```sh
wrangler build
```

This will compile your Rust to WebAssembly. It'll show you any compiler errors you have so you can fix them!
To preview this code in the browser, and get runtime errors in your terminal, you can run:

```sh
wrangler dev
```

If everything worked, you should see:

## Publishing your Worker

And with that, you're finished writing a Cloudflare Workers function with Rust-generated WASM!

Wrangler has built-in support for bundling, uploading, and releasing your Cloudflare Workers application. To do this, we'll run `wrangler publish`, which will _build_ and _publish_ your code to your workers.dev subdomain:

## Resources

In this tutorial, you built and published a Rust-generated WebAssembly serverless function that parses Markdown. If you'd like to see the full source code for this application, you can find it [on GitHub](https://github.com/xortive/rustwasm-markdown-parser).
